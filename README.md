CyanOre: a very rare ore <br>
Cyan: just another one material<br>

CyanArmor: new armor<br>
CyanStairs: more decor items!<br>
CyanStick: more mateterials!<br>

CyanDecraftingTable: the single interesting think in that mod. It can take items to pieces and work some buggy.

ToDo:
1) Fix a major bug with decrafting of CyanHoe
2) Fix a major bug with crafting of CyanHoe
3) Make a not buggy CyanSlab and other blocks for decoration
4) Realize CasinoBlock and CyanFluid
