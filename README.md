CyanOre: a very rare ore <br>
Cyan: just another one material<br>
CyanBlock: a block for the decoration and for some crafts<br>
CyanSword/CyanHoe/CyanShovel/CyanAxe/CyanPickaxe/CyanMultitool: just imbalanced strong tools<br>
CyanArmor: new armor<br>
CyanStairs: more decor items!<br>
CyanStick: more mateterials!<br>
CyanChest: a very big chest<br>
CyanDecraftingTable: the single interesting think in that mod. It can take items to pieces and work some buggy.

ToDo:
1) Make a not buggy CyanSlab and other blocks for decoration
2) Realize CasinoBlock and CyanFluid
3) Fix bugs with decrafting table
